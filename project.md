# ORCA (Operational Risk & Compliance Assistant)

## Project Overview
ORCA is an AI-powered platform built for the manufacturing and industrial automation sector. It leverages cutting-edge technologies such as Large Language Models (LLMs), simulation engines, and IoT sensor data pipelines to deliver intelligent agents that help manufacturers observe, report, comply, and alert on operational risks and compliance challenges.

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Flask** - Python web framework for building the API
- **Python** - Core programming language for ML models and data processing
- **Machine Learning** - Predictive maintenance models using NASA C-MAPSS dataset
- **Gemini Pro API** - Google's GenAI for intelligent insights and summaries

### Frontend
- **Next.js** - React framework for building the dashboard
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework for modern, responsive design
- **React** - Component-based UI library
- **Chart.js/D3.js** - Data visualization libraries for sensor data and predictions

### Data & Infrastructure
- **NASA C-MAPSS Dataset** - Turbofan engine degradation simulation data
- **RESTful API** - Flask backend serving ML predictions and insights
- **Real-time Data Processing** - IoT sensor data pipeline integration

## ORCA's Four Intelligent Modules

### 1. ü¶à PREDATOR (Predictive Maintenance Engine)
- Hunts down early signs of equipment failure before they strike
- Powered by RUL forecasting and anomaly detection using NASA C-MAPSS dataset
- Generates actionable maintenance summaries and task recommendations enhanced by GenAI
- Helps prevent unplanned equipment failures, reducing downtime and maintenance costs

### 2. üõ°Ô∏è GUARDIAN (Regulatory Compliance Sentinel)
- Shields operations by enforcing industry standards and ISO compliance
- Reads, interprets, and aligns processes with compliance laws
- Automates compliance checks and generates audit-ready documentation
- Provides real-time compliance status updates and risk assessments

### 3. üîÆ MIRROR (Digital Twin Intelligence)
- Reflects your factory in a living, breathing simulation
- Runs infinite "what-if" scenarios without real-world risk
- Uses LLMs to interpret simulation results and explain deviations from ideal performance
- Enables predictive scenario planning and workflow optimization

### 4. üö® SIREN (Real-Time Alerting System)
- Watches, listens, and screams when things go wrong
- Delivers instant alerts with context and next-step guidance
- Uses AI to prioritize alerts and recommend remedial actions
- Integrates with existing notification systems and emergency protocols

## Current Implementation Phase: PREDATOR (Predictive Maintenance Engine)

For this phase of the project, the focus is on implementing the **PREDATOR** module:

### Backend (Flask + Python)
- **ML Models**: Trained on NASA C-MAPSS Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation dataset
- **API Endpoints**: RESTful API serving ML model predictions and insights
- **Data Processing**: Real-time sensor data ingestion and preprocessing
- **GenAI Integration**: Gemini Pro API for intelligent maintenance summaries

### Frontend (Next.js + Tailwind)
- **Dashboard**: Modern, responsive interface for monitoring equipment health
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive charts showing sensor data, prediction results, and trends
- **Insights Panel**: GenAI-generated maintenance recommendations and task plans
- **Real-time Updates**: Live data feeds and alert notifications

### Key Features
- Equipment health monitoring and anomaly detection
- Predictive failure analysis with RUL estimation
- AI-powered maintenance planning and scheduling
- Historical data analysis and trend identification
- Exportable reports and compliance documentation

## Project Value Proposition

This phase demonstrates ORCA's core value: **going beyond raw data by understanding, explaining, and acting on predictive insights**. Instead of overwhelming users with complex sensor readings and ML predictions, ORCA translates technical data into actionable, human-readable insights that maintenance teams can immediately use to make informed decisions.
